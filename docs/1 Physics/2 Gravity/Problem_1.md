#  Gravity: Orbital Period and Orbital Radius

##  Motivation

Kepler‚Äôs Third Law reveals that the square of a planet‚Äôs orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (or radius for circular orbits) of its orbit. Mathematically:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

This relationship bridges the laws of motion and gravitation and allows us to calculate orbital parameters for celestial bodies, aiding everything from GPS satellite operations to interplanetary missions.

##  Derivation of the Relationship

Consider a small mass $m$ orbiting a large mass $M$ in a circular orbit of radius $r$. The gravitational force provides the necessary centripetal force:

$$
\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \frac{m v^2}{r}
$$

Cancel $m$ and solve for orbital speed $v$:

$$
v = \sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}
$$

The period $T$ is the time to complete one orbit:

$$
T = \frac{2\pi r}{v} = \frac{2\pi r}{\sqrt{\frac{G M}{r}}} = 2\pi \sqrt{\frac{r^3}{G M}}
$$

Squaring both sides:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{G M} r^3
$$

Thus:

$$
T^2 \propto r^3
$$

##  Implications in Astronomy

* **Calculate planetary masses:** Rearranging the law gives $M = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}$, allowing us to estimate a star's or planet‚Äôs mass.
* **Estimate distances in space:** If you know the period, you can deduce the orbital radius‚Äîand vice versa.
* **Apply to moons, satellites, and exoplanets:** Kepler‚Äôs Law holds for any object under central gravitational force.

## üåç Real-World Examples

### 1. The Moon orbiting Earth

* $r \approx 3.84 \times 10^8$ m
* $T \approx 27.3$ days $= 2.36 \times 10^6$ seconds

Using $T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2 r^3}{GM}$, this checks out with the known mass of Earth $(5.97 \times 10^{24} \text{kg})$.

### 2. Planets in the Solar System

Plotting $\log(T^2)$ vs $\log(r^3)$ gives a straight line‚Äîevidence of Kepler‚Äôs Law.

##  Computational Simulation (Python)

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Constants
G = 6.67430e-11  # m^3 kg^-1 s^-2
M = 1.989e30     # kg (mass of the Sun)

# Orbital radii from 0.1 AU to 30 AU
radii = np.linspace(0.1, 30, 100) * 1.496e11  # in meters

# Calculate orbital periods using Kepler's third law
T = 2 * np.pi * np.sqrt(radii**3 / (G * M))

# Convert radius to AU and period to years for easier interpretation
radii_AU = radii / 1.496e11
T_years = T / (60 * 60 * 24 * 365.25)

# Plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
plt.loglog(radii_AU, T_years, label='Kepler‚Äôs Third Law')
plt.xlabel('Orbital Radius (AU)')
plt.ylabel('Orbital Period (years)')
plt.title('Orbital Period vs Orbital Radius')
plt.grid(True, which='both')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

##  Elliptical Orbits and Generalization

For elliptical orbits, Kepler's Third Law still holds using the **semi-major axis** $a$ instead of the radius:

$$
T^2 = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM} a^3
$$

This insight extends to:

* Binary star systems
* Exoplanets
* Artificial satellites

##  Summary

* The square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the orbital radius: $T^2 \propto r^3$
* This relationship is derived from Newton's law of gravitation and centripetal force
* It enables mass and distance calculations across astronomy
* The simulation confirms the law numerically and visually
